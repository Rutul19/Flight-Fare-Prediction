FLIGHT-FARE PREDICTION
For a traveller it is important to know the fare value of a trip, and as prices of flight ticket varies abruptly and it becomes hectic for a user to check different websites, use different deals. A flight fare prediction model will help inform the travellers with the optimal time to buy their flight tickets and understand trends in the airline industry.

STEPS
We will be using train and test data. Test data is similar to train data minus the ‘price’ column. 2.We can do some data pre-processing and remove variables which are not needed and add some new features like ‘Booking_class’ and ‘market_share’ which will indicate the market share of each airline.
Next step is Feature generation, here we mainly work on the data and do some transformations to extract unknown variables or create different bons of particular columns and clean the messy data.
Do some EDA, data visualisation to understand the relationship between different independent variables and the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables
